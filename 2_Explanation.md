# Problem 2

##    Time complexity

###        O(log(n))

        * The principle of this algorithm is similar to 
            that of the binary search algorithm.
        * Therefore the time complexity is also similar.


##    Space Complexity: 

###        O(1)

        * The algorithm takes constant space. 
        * It is independent of the input no mater the size
