# Problem 3

##    Time complexity

###        O(n log(n))

        * The algorithm involves the use of quicksort sorting method.
        * Therefore the time complexity is also similar.


##    Space Complexity: 

###        O(1)

        * The algorithm doesnt involve any extra space as it involves quicksort.
